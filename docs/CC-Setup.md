# Setting up the Cloud Cannon site

Now we will create our cloud cannon account and site which will enable us to edit our site visually and easily access our files.

Once your account is created add a new site with the **Add New Site** button.

Give your site a name. Choose GitHub repository as the source and set it to your recently created portfolio. Under branch choose existing and choose main (this will probably be the only option anyway). Then press sync files.
