## Setting up Cloud Cannon to use MKDocs via browser/cloud

Hey everyone, this MKDocs site will be a guide on how to use MKDocs via a browser/the cloud. This has many added benefits such as a visual editing interface which includes a suite of standard formatting tools such as adding bold text, images bullet lists etc. all from within the visual editor. I'm even using it to write this entire tutorial.

## What is Cloud Cannon?

Cloud cannon is a git-based CMS. What that means is Cloud Cannon connects to your GitHub Repository and then edits the files directly inside that repository.  There are other git-based CMS platforms out there so feel free to discover them on your own. We'll take a look at setting up our GitHub on the next page.

Something I will mention is that there are a few caveats to using Cloud Cannon but I will cover them as we get to them.

We'll also need a few pre-requisites before we can fully begin but I'll take you through it as best as I can.
