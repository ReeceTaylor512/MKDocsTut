# Setting up CloudCannon to use MKDocs via browser/cloud

Hey everyone, this MKDocs site will be a guide on how to use MKDocs via a browser/the cloud. This has many added benefits such as a visual editing interface which includes a suite of standard formatting tools such as adding bold text, images bullet lists etc. all from within the visual editor. I'm even using it to write this entire tutorial.

We'll need a few pre-requisites before we can fully begin but I'll take you through it as best as I can.
