# Setting up Github

The first thing we need to do is set up a Github account and a Github repository. This will hold our files for Cloud Cannon to edit directly. When you upload to GitHub the files will stay with you and are not tied to Cloud Cannon so you won't lose them.

You will first need an account so go to <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and create one then come back here.

On your main GitHub page click on **repositories**, there you will see a green "**New**" button. Click on that to create a new repository.

On the new repository screen the main thing that is needed is a name. If you want to make your repo **private** you can do. A **README** file is basically just a **Markdown** file used as a description on GitHub. I didn't add a **.gitignore** but if you want to add one choose Python.

Note: A **.gitignore** will ignore specified files. You might use this to omit certain files from being uploaded such as videos or audio which could take up a lot of files.

Now we need to add our files, since we will use our already existing files with this let's choose upload an existing file.
